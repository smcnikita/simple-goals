# Simple Goals

**Simple Goals** is a user-friendly app for creating, planning, and tracking your annual goals. We help you stay focused
on what matters, break big tasks into manageable steps, and monitor your progress throughout the year.

The project is currently under active development, but you can already start using it and try out the core features. We
are constantly working to improve the app to make it as useful and convenient as possible for you.

If you prefer to use the app independently, without relying on cloud services, you can deploy it on your own server
(self-hosted). This gives you full control over your data and customization options.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or encounter an issue, please let us know on Github. Your feedback helps us
improve!
